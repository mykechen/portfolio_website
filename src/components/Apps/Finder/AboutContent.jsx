          Hey there! I'm Myke, a junior at the University of Southern California
          studying CS, Business, and AI.
          <br />
          <br />
          Curiosity drives everything I build. Growing up in the Netherlands,
          Shanghai, Chicago, and now Los Angeles, I've learned to see problems
          from different angles—and I love turning that perspective into
          products people actually use. I've built Chrome extensions to boost
          productivity, an app that gamifies live sports, and I'm currently
          developing an AI roommate (feel free to check it out!). Each project
          starts with a "what if?" and ends with real code, thoughtful design,
          and lots of iteration.
          <br />
          <br />
          What keeps me going? The moment when something clicks after hours of
          debugging, or when a user tells me my tool saved them time. I'm
          energized by the process itself—breaking down complex problems, trying
          new approaches, and learning something unexpected with every build.
          Building isn't just what I do; it's how I think.
          <br />
          <br />
          I'm always open to new ideas, collaborations, or just chatting about
          building cool things.
