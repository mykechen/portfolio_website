    question: "If you could instantly master one skill, what would it be?",
    answer:
      "Language learning. My family speaks over eight languages, and I’d love to be able to connect with everyone without a barrier. Communication brings people closer, and that’s something I really value.",
  },

    question: "What's on your bucket list?",
    answer:
      "Travel to all seven continents, see the northern lights, and climb Mount Everest. Outside of travel, I want to start my own company, give a TED Talk someday, and mentor younger builders who are just getting started.",
  },

    id: 3,
    question: "What's one piece of advice that changed how you think?",
    answer:
      "Motivation only gets you started, but discipline and systems keep you going. You won’t always feel inspired, but if you have structure, you’ll make progress anyway. One quote that really stuck with me is from James Clear: 'You do not rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems.'",
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "What do you wish you knew when you first started coding?",
    answer:
      "Stop watching tutorials. Just open your laptop and build something you actually care about. Don’t get stuck in tutorial hell like I did, because you only learn by doing, not watching.",
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "How do you learn from mistakes?",
    answer:
      "I try to break down what actually went wrong instead of just feeling bad about it. Mistakes usually point out blind spots you didn’t know you had, so I take that as data, reflect, and use it to move forward smarter.",
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "How do you stay adaptable when things change fast?",
    answer:
      "I focus on learning, not control. Every change is a chance to grow, and if I can stay curious instead of rigid, I usually end up better off than before.",
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: "What's the last rabbit hole you fell down on the internet?",
    answer:
      "I ended up deep in a rabbit hole about how golf balls are made. The layers, the dimples, the materials, everything affects spin, distance, and control. It’s crazy how much engineering and physics go into something that looks so simple.",
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question: "What's your favorite product?",
    answer:
      "Spotify. It’s one of the few products that feels personal yet effortless. It gets me without me needing to explain myself.",
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    question: "What do you like to do?",
    answer:
      "I love hiking, stargazing, playing basketball and golf, and taking photos. Anything that helps me slow down, think, and get inspired again.",
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    question: "What is one habit you are trying to build?",
    answer:
      "Cold showers every morning. It’s less about the health benefits and more about discipline. Doing something uncomfortable first thing helps me start the day strong.",
  },
  {
    id: 11,
    question: "What is a class that changed how you think?",
    answer:
      "Negotiation. It taught me that communication isn’t about winning, it’s about understanding people and finding outcomes that work for both sides.",
  },
  {
    id: 12,
    question: "What is your dream job?",
    answer:
      "Working on a product that combines technology, creativity, and human connection to make a real impact on people's lives.",
  },
  {
    id: 13,
    question: "How do you give and receive feedback?",
    answer:
      "With honesty and curiosity. I see feedback as collaboration, not criticism, because it’s how good ideas become great ones.",
